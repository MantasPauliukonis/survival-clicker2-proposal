### Effects system
All consumables when used are turned into effects. Same goes with actions that player does. Every effect has **description** of what it affects also **strength** and **duration**.

For example: `Restore Health 5 points for 30 seconds`

When active this will restore players' health by 5 points of 30 seconds of game time.

So effects might be permanent and might not have a duration (TBD)
