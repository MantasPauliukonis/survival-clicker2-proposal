# survival-clicker2-proposal

## Intro

To completely understand the following please check the original game if you haven't already done so.

Everything that is written here is meant to re-iterate and improve on the original idea that will later be turned into an operational game (fingers crossed).

[Play the original game here](http://survival.clicker.7777.lt)

## Stats

### Stomach
Every consumable has a weight value which goes into stomach. Stomach can not be overfilled or there will be negative side-effects if done so. There will be no penalty for empty stomach (like in original game).

### Stamina
Every action will drain stamina, more intense action is more stamina it will drain.

## Attributes
Number higher than 1, most likely to go to infinity.

### Strength
Defines how strong the character is.

## Effects
All consumables when used are turned into effects. Same goes with actions that player does. Every effect has **description** of what it affects also **strength** and **duration**.

For example: `Restore Health 5 points for 30 seconds`

When active this will restore players' health by 5 points of 30 seconds of game time.

So effects might be permanent and might not have a duration (TBD)

## Prestige system

While game will have a death where player looses progress, this mechanic will be merged with prestige system. Means that player will come back with some additional bonus (TBD)
