# survival-clicker2-proposal

## Intro

To completely understand the following please check the original game if you haven't already done so.

Everything that is written here is meant to re-iterate and improve on the original idea that will later be turned into a operational game (fingers crossed).

## Stats

### Stomach
Every constumable has a weight value which goes into stomach. Stomach can not be overfilled or there might be negative side-effects if done so. There will be no penalty for empty stomach (like in original game).

## Effects
All consumables when used are turned into effects. Same goes with actions that player does. Every effect has **description** of what it affects also **strength** and **duration**.

For example: `Restore Health 5 points for 30 seconds`

When active this will restore players' health by 5 points of 30 seconds of game time.

So effects might be permanent and might not have a duration (TBD)
