# Effects
All consumables when used are turned into effects. Same goes with actions that player does. Every effect has **description** of what it affects also **strength** and **duration**.

For example: `Restore Health 5 pts for 30 seconds`

When active this will restore players' health by 5 points of 30 seconds of game time.

Some effects might be permanent and might not have a duration (TBD)

#### Stacking same type of effects
~~When adding new effects to characters effect list if same type is encountered, strength will be averaged out based on duration.~~
Stacking effects might be overpowered, looking for a solution...
