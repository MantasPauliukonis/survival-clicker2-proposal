# Stats

Stats have min and max values

## List

### Stomach
Every consumable has a weight value which goes into stomach. Stomach can not be overfilled or there will be negative side-effects if done so. There will be no penalty for empty stomach (like in original game).

### Stamina
Every action will drain stamina, more intense action is more stamina it will drain.
