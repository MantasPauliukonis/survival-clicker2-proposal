# Skills/Perks
Each attribute has it's own set of perks. Character starts with all perks at level 0. Once unlocked levels goes up to 1.

Perks level up as actions associated with them are executed (debatable).
Actions fill experience bar on each skill.

Experience needed for next level is calculated using: 
`baseExperience * 1.2^(currentLevel - 1)`

with `baseExperience` of `100`

|Level|Experience|
|---|---|
|1|100|
|2|120|
|3|144|
|5|207~|
|10|516~|
|25|7950~|
